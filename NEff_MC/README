GoodGuysBadGuys.C/.h
-------------------- 
... was originally created from veto->MakeClass("GoodGuysBadGuys") in gun_x34_veto.root, which Erin had produced from S4Det and running vetoTree.cc as a selection.
The data structure is relatively complicated, with vectors per event, through which one has to loop through. The GoodGuysBadGuys.C/.h does some classification of events based on process (inelastic, Hadronelastic,...), spawn_volume (p_active, p_veto) and type (nucleus, baryon, ...). These classifications are stored in an output ntuple, where columns have the format [variable]__[selection], e.g. qdep_active__inelastic__active (quenched energy deposited in the active volume) for inelastic processes in the 'active' volume. The output ntupe is stored in an output root file, e.g. gun_x34_veto_goodguysbadguys.root
It comes with a Makefile to produce an executable, which runs reasonably fast and allows for better debugging

ROOT macros:
------------
- UseGoodGuysBadGuys.C
... runs consistency and sanity checks on the output, thereby validating the logic applied in GoodGuysBadGuys.C/.h
It also illustrates the usage of AddFriend()

- AnalyseThis.C
... is even simpler and just friends the tree, so that one can formulate queries on the ROOT commandline and make plots.
