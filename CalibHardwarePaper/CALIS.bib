@article{janecek_reflectivity_2012,
abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations play an important role in developing and evaluating the performance of radiation detection systems. To accurately model a reflector in an optical Monte Carlo simulation, the reflector's spectral response has to be known. We have measured the reflection coefficient for many commonly used reflectors for wavelengths from 250 nm to 800 nm. The reflectors were also screened for fluorescence and angular distribution changes with wavelength. The reflectors examined in this work include several polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) reflectors, Spectralon, GORE diffuse reflector, titanium dioxide paint, magnesium oxide, nitrocellulose filter paper, Tyvek paper, Lumirror, Melinex, ESR films, and aluminum foil. All PTFE films exhibited decreasing reflectivity with longer wavelengths due to transmission. To achieve {\{}{\textgreater}{\}};0.95 reflectivity in the 380 to 500 nm range, the PTFE films have to be at least 0.5 mm thick-nitrocellulose is a good alternative if a thin diffuse reflector is needed. Several of the reflectors have sharp declines in reflectivity below a cut-off wavelength, including TiO2 (420 nm), ESR film (395 nm), nitrocellulose (330 nm), Lumirror (325 nm), and Melinex (325 nm). PTFE-like reflectors were the only examined reflectors that had reflectivity above 0.90 for wavelengths below 300 nm. Lumirror, Melinex, and ESR film exhibited fluorescence. Lumirror and Melinex are excited by wavelengths between 320 and 420 nm and have their emission peaks located at 440 nm, while ESR film is excited by wavelengths below 400 nm and the emission peak is located at 430 nm. Lumirror and Melinex also exhibited changing angular distributions with wavelength.},

abstract = {The efficiency of quenching the fluorescence light in pseudocumene (PC) by the addition of pyridyl and phthalate derivatives (quenchers) has been studied both by ultraviolet excitation of PC and by using ionizing particles. The results show that a controlled reduction of the PC fluorescence is easily achieved by the addition of quencher in concentrations of a few grams per litre. The scintillation light can be quenched to a level where the Cherenkov light remains the only detectable signal when ionizing particles deposit energy in the solvent. While these data are of particular interest for the design of the Borexino buffer, more general applications of these results are envisaged and discussed.},

Each pool is covered by a plane of resistive plate chambers as an additional means of detecting muons. Design, construction, operation, and performance of these muon detectors are described.},

abstract = {A 4.8 m3 unsegmented liquid scintillation detector at the underground Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso has shown the feasibility of multi-ton low-background detectors operating to energies as low as 250 keV. Detector construction and the handling of large volumes of liquid scintillator to minimize the background are described. The scintillator, 1.5 g PPO/L-pseudocumene, is held in a flexible nylon vessel shielded by 1000 t of purified water. The active detector volume is viewed by 100 photomultipliers, which measure time and charge for each event, from which energy, position and pulse shape are deduced. On-line purification of the scintillator by water extraction, vacuum distillation and nitrogen stripping removed radioactive impurities. Upper limits were established of {\textless} 10−7 Bq/kg-scintillator for events with energies 250 keV {\textless} E {\textless} 800 keV, and {\textless} 10−9 Bq/kg-scintillator due to the decay products of uranium and thorium. The isotopic abundance of 14C12C in the scintillator was shown to be approximately 10−18 by extending the energy window of the detector to 25–250 keV. The 14C abundance and uranium and thorium levels in the CTF are compatible with the Borexino Solar Neutrino Experiment.},

abstract = {The radioisotope concentrations in stainless steel for the cryostat of the GERDA experiment at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) have been measured. A total of 13 different stainless steel batches have been screened by low-level $\gamma$ -ray spectrometry with germanium detectors located at two underground laboratories. The article reports the discovery of commonly available stainless steel with very low concentrations of primordial and cosmogenic radionuclides. The concentrations are in the range of 1 mBq/kg and below. Only the manmade 60Co-isotope is present in all samples with a higher concentration of around 19 mBq/kg. Further, deviations from secular equilibrium in the natural decay chains of U and Th have been observed in some cases.},

abstract = {Neutrons are a particularly dangerous background for direct WIMP dark matter searches; their nuclear recoils with the target nucleus are often indistinguishable from nuclear recoils produced by WIMP-nuclear collisions. In this study, we explore the concept of a liquid scintillator neutron veto detector that would allow direct dark matter detectors to potentially reject neutrons with greater than 99{\%} efficiency. Here we outline the construction and testing of a small prototype detector and the potential implications of this technology for future dark matter detectors.},

@article{alimonti_liquid_2009,
abstract = {The successful deployment of the Borexino solar neutrino detector required assorted physical and chemical operations to produce exceptional pure fluids and fill multiple detector zones. The composition and flow rates of high purity gases and liquids had to be precisely controlled to maintain liquid levels and pressures. The system was required to meet exceptional requirements for cleanliness and leak-tightness. A large scale modular system connecting fluid receiving, purification and fluid delivery processes was developed for Borexino. At the core is a flow control system that delivers scintillator components to plants for purification, and then fills the Borexino detector volumes with ultrahigh purity buffer or ultrahigh purity scintillator. The liquid handling system maintains precise control over the liquid levels and differential pressures between the different volumes of the detectors that are separated by flexible nylon vessels. The preparation, commissioning and operation of the system for filling the Borexino detector with scintillator is described.},

@article{caccianiga_multiplexed_2003,
abstract = {A multiplexed system of optical fibers has been designed for the photomultiplier calibration of the Borexino experiment at Gran Sasso. Both time and energy calibration are of paramount importance in Borexino for the measurement of the solar 7Be neutrino flux. Equalization of photomultipliers within 1 ns is required to define a Fiducial Volume to isolate a very pure internal region of observation, and accurate energy determination and resolution are crucial for the spectral shape recognition of the neutrino signal. The size of the detector, its tightness and radiopurity constraints require special care in the material selection and mechanical handling of the system. The solution of multiplexed fiber chains has been realized for the first time in a large underground detector. In this paper we illustrate the PMT calibration system design and the results of various feasibility tests performed.},
