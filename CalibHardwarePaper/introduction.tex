\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}\label{sec:introduction}

\dsf\ is a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (\lar\ \tpc), operated in the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) in Italy to search for nuclear recoils induced by weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). The first physics result was reported in \cite{Agnes:2015gu} based on 50 live days of data collected with Atmospheric Argon (AAr), providing the most sensitive limit on a dark matter search using a \lar\ \tpc\ to date with a 90\% CL upper limit on the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section of $6.1 x 10^{-44}$ cm$^2$ for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV/c$^2$.  %along with two other key results: ar bg can be suppressed for ton-scale experiments using \uar and efficiency of the veto 

The \dsf\ apparatus has been described in detail in \cite{Agnes:2015gu}. As shown in fig.~\ref{fig:wholeAssembly_insideDetectors} it features a \lar\ \tpc\ surrounded by a 30 t liquid scintillator-based veto (LSV) system, placed inside a water Cerenkov veto detector (\wcv), both of which measure in-situ and suppress radiogenic and cosmogenic backgrounds. On top of the \wcv\ is a radon-free clean room (CRH) housing the cryogenic supply system and electronics (Fig.~\ref{fig:CALIS_photos}). The inside of the \lsv\ is accessible from CRH through four access ports called organ pipes closed by gate valves. 

%After this introduction the CALIS design requirements and hardware realization are described in Sec.~\ref{sec:hardware}. Calibration campaigns and some of their physics highlights are discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:CalibCampaigns}, before concluding in Sec.~\ref{sec:Conclusion}.

deployed in the liquid scintillator veto (LSV, 5) next to the liquid argon time projection chamber's (\lar\ \tpc) cryostat (6). The clean room and the LSV are connected through four access ports called organ pipes (only one of which is drawn in the sketch above: (7)). All four organ pipes end in CRH at gate valves (8) which can be manually opened or closed. During normal operations all four organ pipes are closed. Not included in the sketch are tubes connecting the cryogenic systems in CRH to the cryostat in the \lsv\ \cite{Agnes:2015qyz}.\label{fig:wholeAssembly_insideDetectors}\label{fig:DS50_with_CALIS}}

The organ pipe is 80 cm off-center with respect to the TPC center in the horizontal XY plane. \textit{right}: Photograph taken with a camera looking upwards into the LSV from the bottom. It shows the source deployment device deployed through one of the organ pipes visible on the top right. The arm is articulated and the source is next to the cryostat of the \lar\ \tpc\ \cite{Agnes:2015qyz}.

\subsection*{Laser calibration}
Electronics gain calibration of the \wcv, \lsv\ and \tpc\ is performed with dedicated Laser systems, that are in place in each of the three subdetectors. The Laser calibration in the \wcv\ is sufficient to veto muons (and their secondaries) with high efficiency. The \tpc\ detector response has been calibrated using the internal ${39}$Ar as well as $83m$Kr, that has been added into the \lar\ recirculation system during dedicated calibration campaigns \cite{Agnes:2015gu}.
