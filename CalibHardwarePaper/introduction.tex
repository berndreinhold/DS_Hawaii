\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}\label{sec:introduction}

\dsf\ is a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (\lar\ \tpc), operated in the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) in Italy to search for nuclear recoils induced by weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). A first physics result was reported in \cite{ds:ds-50:firstpaper} based on 50 live days of data collected with Atmospheric Argon (AAr), providing the most sensitive limit on a dark matter search using a \lar\ \tpc\ to date with a 90\% CL upper limit on the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section of $6.1 x 10^{-44}$ cm$^2$ for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV/c$^2$.  %along with two other key results: ar bg can be suppressed for ton-scale experiments using \uar and efficiency of the veto 

The \dsf\ apparatus has been described in detail in \cite{ds:ds-50:firstpaper}, but for the reader's convenience a short reminder is given. As shown in fig.~\ref{fig:wholeAssembly_insideDetectors} it features a \lar\ \tpc\ surrounded by a 30 t liquid scintillator-based veto (LSV) system, which in turn is housed in a water Cerenkov detector (WCD), both of which help to measure in-situ and suppress radiogenic and cosmogenic backgrounds. On top of the WCD there is a clean room (CRH) which houses the cryogenic supply system, the electronics and slow control software, among other things. The LSV is accessible from CRH through four access ports nick named organ pipes which end in gate valves. The CALibration source Insertion System (CALIS) is connected to one of the gate valves and allows to deploy radioactive sources through the organ pipe into the neutron veto and position it next to the cryostat of the \lar\ \tpc. (fig.~\ref{fig:CALIS_photos}, right).

The goal with the calibration source insertion system CALIS is to study and calibrate the detector response of the \tpc\ and the \lsv\ as well as the detection efficiency of internal neutrons interacting in the \tpc\ and \lsv\ using radioactive gamma and neutron sources. The WCD in contrast is gain calibrated only using a Laser system, which is sufficient to veto muons (and their secondaries) with high efficiency.

  %CALIS has several degrees of freedom to position the source at various positions relative to the \lar\ \tpc thereby mapping out detector response and detection efficiency as a function of position. In particular sources close to the cryostat wall of the TPC. Thanks to degrees of freedom in the XY plane it can also be operated away from the cryostat.

After this introduction the CALIS design requirements and hardware realization are described in Sec.~\ref{sec:hardware}. The testing, cleaning and commissioning before and after the installation in CRH are outlined in Sec.~\ref{sec:commissioning}. Analysis results are discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis}, before concluding in Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
