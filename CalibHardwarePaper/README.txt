introduction: DarkSide


safety - TMB

system re


using the paper requires a rewrite of the paragraphs.


possible extensions of the system (outlook) 

physics reach:

performance:

- Co57 t_drift distributions data-MC comparisons
- Ba133 multi-peak (make your own plots!!!)

- calibration complements

- XY distributions of left and right

- stability

source selection prior to the campaign

characterization at FNAL
characterization at LNGS



PMT calibration

other sources
 
WT calibration

how many runs? 

stability

1. step: what can we report without further effort?
2. 80 % job at first. Write everything without looking things up.
3. work block-wise. Think, decide, then don't question anymore, until this block is done. Increase your threshold for things to forget (it is too low). If it was important, it will come back/ show again.

%%%%%There are two main design goals
%In designing and implementing CALIS the following constraints have to be taken into account and 
%The system includes several safety features to ensure safe deployment and retrieval of the source without affecting the neutron veto detector:


For different physics analyses there are different requirements on knowing the source position, yet based on experience during testing and commissioning of CALIS, we aim at an accuracy and precision at the $\pm 1$ cm level both in Z and XY. Analysis results on this are shown in Sec.~\ref{sec:Analysis:Position}.

Small level and pressure changes as introduced by the pig during insertion into the LS can be tolerated by the \lsv\ and are taken care of by the slow control system.

Health hazard from LS fumes for people and environment CALIS III has been
tested to be leak free with a helium leak test. Once the gate valve is
closed and prior to any manipulation of the source through viewport, CALIS
III will be thoroughly flushed with N2 to avoid any health hazard.!
