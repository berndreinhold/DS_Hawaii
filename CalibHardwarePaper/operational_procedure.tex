%part of testing, cleaning and commissioning section

\subsection{Operational Procedure}
After the testing and commissioning CALIS has been installed inside CRH... 

Well, there also have been test deployments before that.
\subsubsection{Source Insertion}

\subsubsection{3 special positions}
home position or parking position - gate valve closed. The 

center of the TPC.

Full extension position - length of the cable.






\paragraph{Opening the Gate Valve}
\subsubsection{Positioning of Source}
\paragraph{Contact with Cryostat}
\paragraph{Cameras}
\subsubsection{Source Retraction and Extraction}
The source may not get in contact with the liquid scintillator. It is therefore sealed during the deployment in a dedicated source holder. In order to exchange sources the source arm and source holder has to be extracted from the pig into CRH and thereby comes in contact with normal air, containing oxygen and traces of water. After insertion a flush \& purge cycle is used to reduce, as known from glove boxes. No glove box present. Much more compact design.
% no glove box

After each deployment check that there is no leakage of Scintillator inside the source holder.
