Luca:
-----
took from you: 
- Cherenkov
- winding radius
- LSVwith -> LSV with
- reversed order for 83mKr and 39Ar

question:
- full stop or colon, ":"? Does one continue with a big letter after ":"?
- o-ring or O-ring


kept it: 
- the gap-sentence
- Fig. - kept it
- in-situ 
- weakly interacting ...
- 1.4 g/l PPO is our nominal

reply to Marco: all in there
reply to Cristian, Roberto - Xiao

Grzegorz:
---------
following your suggestion:
- split the sentence
- CRH for Clean Room Hanoi
- removed second definition on L.34
- L.133-L.154: we used the same high purity nitrogen, that is also used as blanket for the liquid scintillator veto - its the same supply line.
- acknowledgement: changed grant
- FNAL --- fixed


todo:
- DS20k reference

keep:
- abstract in definition - give the definition for when it is used the first time
- L.42: from within? --- confirmed with native speaker
- the two unit systems reflect our American/European experiment. CALIS was designed and contructed in the US (using mostly imperial and some metric) and then built into the experiment, which is mostly using metric units.

> veto paper (which is first cited only at page 16) --- agreed and introduced after "... suppress radiogenic and cosmogenic backgrounds"
> 2- Line 81, no space between "LSW with"  --- fixed, thanks
> 3- L330, maybe use an expression like "to the measurements taken in the
> SCENE experiment", so every reader can quickly get what SCENE is. --- sounds good, implemented
> 4- Caption of table 1, "83Rb which have a" -> maybe "which has" (it
> refers to 83Rb right?) --- implemented
> 5- Caption of table 1, maybe 83mKr "nuclei" instead of "atoms" ? --- implemented
> 6- Title of 4.4.1, maybe "TPC scintillation yield from 57Co" sounds better --- done
> 7- Maybe a sentence about possible scalability of CALIS concept to
> DS-20k (if possible) ?
> 8- There is alternation of words "gamma" and "$\gamma$-ray", maybe you

> 9-Can you please add a "m" (INFN Genova) to my affiliations? --- done
