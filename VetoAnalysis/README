1. copied files:
transferred DSTfiles produced by Hao from /home/hqian/ds50analysis/darkart/haoanalysis/DSTAwayData/ and DSTSlaveData/ on ds50login (using Erin's account) to /scratch/darkside/reinhol1/Veto/ on ds50srv01
1b. ProduceDSTs/:
- SelfMacroDST.C runs on ODrec files and produces DSTs. Based on Hao's macro (which I adjusted to fix some bugs and remove the coincidence with the TPC).
- these are for Shawn's variation of thresholds study, where I got ODrec output files and I need to produce DSTs
- addtrees.py - simple script running on Shawn's odrec output, calling 'hadd'

#this step requires DSTs:
2. Veto_TMBAlphaOnly_TreeFromChain.C to produce one common Tree in the output file from the chain -> easier handling: 
DSTAwayData_PPO_06.root and DSTAwayData_PPO_15.root in /scratch/darkside/reinhol1/Veto/DSTAwayData/

March 3, 2015: generalized Veto_TMBAlphaOnly_TreeFromChain.C to process Shawn variation of thresholds.


also for DSTRandomData (and maybe later for slave mode data)
3.TMBAlphaOnly_DSTAwayData.C/.h -> just refill variables, no recalculation of them
Here the physics selection is done: based on a time cut (20, 30, 60, 100 us) ignoring all ringing after the prompt. Then take the first right after this cut as neutron capture. Then there are afterpulses after the neutron.
_AC variables: AfterCut, which is a time cut and a veto of 10 us before the window.
      od2_nclusters_AfterTimeCut=0;
      od2_nclusters_AfterTimeCut_AC=0;
these might be doubled -> yes, removed one.

- generalized to select also on the delayed energy before filling to get rid of an accidental component
- study the veto again.

- added RunTMB.C - runs TMBAlphaOnly_DSTAwayData.C/.h in various configurations... - 

4. Veto_TMBAlphaOnly_Plots.C - fill histograms into outfile and then make background subtraction and fits there in a second step.

5. Plot - made the Pics subdirectory for a cleaner directory.
